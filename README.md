## setting up your dev environment

* Install Rust 1.26+ <https://rustup.rs/>

## Style guide

- For Rust code: run `rustfmt`
- For Markdown: don't hard-wrap text at any particular column.
  Instead, do one line per sentence.
  It feels and looks weird at first and then it's _omg so nice_ to not have to rewrap paragraphs when tweaking stuff you wrote before.
  And when rendered as HTML, it shows up like a regular paragraph.
  At least, in my opinion.
- For Git:
  - please follow [this guide][git-commit-messages] to writing good commit messages.
  - please avoid [merge bubbles]
