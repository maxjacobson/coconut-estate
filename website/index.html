      Note to folks working on this: you should pretty much never see this.

      (If you don't work on this don't keep reading ;)

      The idea is that in production, the ember app will overwrite this,
      And in production you won't visit the rust backend directly, but rather
      Run both the backend (bin/website-backend) and the frontend
      (bin/website-frontend) and then visit the port for the frontend to work
      on the site, and the front-end will make requests to the rust back end
      like an API only
